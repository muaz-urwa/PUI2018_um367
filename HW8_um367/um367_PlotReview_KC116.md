# This is the plot rendered by um367 (he did several, so I picked my favorite)

Urwa is clearly one of the more advanced students in this class, so it's a bit difficult for me to accurately evaluate his work. That said, his choice of data could not be more relevant and useful!  I like that he chose to do a text analysis of our course work. It illuminates the work we are doing and the rate of importance for each concept. Very creative!

Urwa rendered three plots, but the one displayed above is my favorite. It's simple and easy to interpret. The frequency distribution shows the rate at which particular concepts are discussed within the lectures. My only note is that he could have cleaned the data a bit, as to not include words like "using" or "exactly," which I don't think offer any meaningful interpretation.
